## Getting Started
   
This project was designed to operate on an AWS EC2 instance with Apache Tomcat and Jenkins as part of CI/CD. However, it can also run locally. To download and run a local copy of this project, start by git cloning this repository to your preferred directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/Alteras1/Expense-Reimbursement-System.git
```
Inside `src/main/resources` contains a PostgreSQL script that will set up the database. Please run it in your database instance. To connect your code to the database, please edit the relevant information listed in the `pom.xml`'s `systemPropertyVariables` within the `maven-surefire-plugin`, as well Java system variables, setting `aws_url`, `aws_password`, and `aws_username` to the database url, password, and username.

Once the database is properly set up, you can run the program through a Apache Tomcat server, where it will be hosted under the endpoint `/Reimbursement`.
